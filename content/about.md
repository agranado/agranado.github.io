## Alejandro A. Granados, Ph.D.

**Principal Data Scientist | Computational Biology | AI Systems**

I build production AI systems for biological discovery—pipelines that biologists use daily, benchmarked against human expert performance.

### Current Work

At **Calico Life Sciences**, I lead computational efforts across five drug programs, including two in Phase II clinical trials. My focus is designing LLM-agent pipelines that combine deterministic bioinformatics with language model reasoning—systems that have processed hundreds of datasets, generated novel hypotheses, and accelerated discovery timelines from weeks to hours.

### Background

- **2006**: Genomics BS in Mexico—one of few programs worldwide
- **2012**: PhD at Imperial College London—microscopy, yeast, information theory
- **2018**: Postdoc at Caltech with Michael Elowitz—mammalian synthetic biology, signaling pathway architecture
- **2021**: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub—building single-cell atlases
- **2023**: Calico—translational data science, drug development, AI systems

### Beyond Science

When I'm not building AI systems, I produce electronic music as **Trascrypt**—experimental sounds somewhere between ambient and industrial.
